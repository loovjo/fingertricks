Grips:
    0: index on FLD/FRD, thumb on BL/BR
    1: 0+L'/R
    ...
    4: 3+L'/R

Regrip: Left hand grip/Right hand grip
    Ex: 2/1 is the common grip before a Y-perm
    if the grip is the same as before for one hand, it can be omitted


Fingers:
    t = thumb
    s = index (stadns for second, so that I and l won't be confused)
    (m = middle)
    r = ring
    l = little

Moves with fingers:
    Finger, where uppercase means left hand, lowercase means right hand. Pushing with the finger (
    away from the hand) is marked with a ', pulling is no suffix. When doing a double move,

Ex: 2/2 s = 2/2 S' = U

Moves changing grip:
    H = left, h = right (mnemonic: hand)
    No suffix = increase number (L' / R)
    Suffix ' = decrease number (L / R')
    Suffix 2 = increase by 2 (L'2 / R2)
    Suffix 2' = increase by 2 (L'2 / R2)

TODO: Wide moves

Example:
    T-perm: 2/2 h S' h' S h' s h2 S h' S h S' h' t'
